applications of message brokers:

** Queuing
Messages are added to the queue and processed sequentially. This application is suitable for scenarios where there is no need to process requests at the same time and messages need to be processed in turn.

** Publish/Subscribe
A service can publish messages and other services can listen to these messages and receive them. This method is used for real-time notification to several other services.

** Event Processing
When an event occurs, a message is created and published, and other services respond to it. This application is suitable for event-driven architecture design.

** Task Processing
In this scenario, various tasks are sent to the message broker and other services receive and process the tasks from the queue. It is suitable for distributing tasks between several services.

Delayed Processing
Messages are added to the queue but processed with a certain delay. It is used to perform operations that must be performed at a certain time (such as reminders).
